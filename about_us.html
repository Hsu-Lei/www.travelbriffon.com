		<h3 style="font-family: cursive; font-size:13px; letter-spacing: 1px;">Our Team chose this topic after thinking much. When we first got the driving question, We thought a lot. We thought what kind of website would fit in the question we were given and we finally got the idea, "A Travelling Agency". We faced some difficulties while making this website. But our team members helped one another and found out the errors. We had fun during this short time and our team's members also proved what the team work is. Sometimes we even stayed up til midnight or make meetings. The team members finished their work in-time responsively. Without their hard work, this website wouldn't have finished. We also hope our website helps you in some ways! A month passed so fast but it will forever be memorable.</h3>

					<p class="text" style="padding: 12px;">As it's expected, layouting and designing webpages at the first place was pretty simple and easy as usual. Of course, I faced some difficulties in making webpages responsive and collecting information processes. However, it seems like I did overcome them all and so do my other team members.I have been learning ICT subject since last year June and now I'm beyond beginner level and already understood fundamental concepts of html, CSS (web development basic tools). And Hopefully, the travel website about Myanmar that we've made can provide necessary information for tourist community.</p>

					<p class="text" style="padding: 12px;">Both ict theories and web developing wasn't that easy as I expected. It's impossible to remember all the codes I have learned through the year but it gives myriad enjoyments when you can successfully fix the bugs.Ict was easy and more interesting at first but as times passed,it was more difficult than before, especially web developing.For me,I believe working with others is more effective and easier than working individually as we can separate the duties and finish within a short duration.In general, ict was an extraordinary subject for me to took up.</p>

					<p class="text" style="padding: 12px;">To be Honest, ICT is probably a new subject for me as I was a student from government school. At first, it’s hard and forceful as it’s not a familiar subject to me and I have undergone lots of difficulties. But now, I think I am a bit interested in it, especially making websites and coding. I realize that we can’t loathe ICT as it has underlying consequences in our humanity and modern technical world. It provides us lots of knowledge, comprehension and it obviously ameliorates our critical thinking skill. Accordingly, I hope I can keep on learning that interesting subject in the future. </p>

					<p class="text" style="padding: 12px;">I will be honest, learning ICT is like riding a rollercoaster. It's exciting yet very complicated sometimes. I got some knowledges about ICT while attending year9 thanks to my classmates and teacher. They helped me a lot. If you ask me what the most difficult part of ICT is, maybe everything? Actually, every single thing related to ICT is not easy. Sometimes I hate this subject, but then I love it again. However, I'll keep trying to improve my skills in this subject since it is interesting and I believe, it will be useful to me one day. (I still can't understand why people want to be web developers tho)</p>
